          <h3>Hello! My name is Wendi.</h3>
          <p>I'm currently a student at the University of Washington studying
          computer science. Although Iâ€™m not certain what my future career is
          going to be, I do hope it is something that allows me to be creative!
          I created this website as a way for me to showcase my creative side
          and incorporate it with what I am learning. Also, it is a place for
          me to store some of my favorite recipes! This website is far from
          complete, as I still have many ideas that I would like to include!</p>
          <h3>Welcome to my page! :)</h3>
